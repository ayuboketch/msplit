## How It Works

### Payment Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
A[Payment Menu] --> B[Enter Till/Paybill]
B --> C{Split Bill?}
C -->|Yes| D[Select Contacts]
C -->|No| F[Confirmation]
D --> E[Adjust Amounts]
E --> G[Payment Method]
G --> F[Confirmation]
F --> H[Complete Payment]
```

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Payment Type Selection**: Choose between Pay Bill, Buy Goods, or other options
2. **Business Details**: Enter till/paybill number and total amount
3. **Split Decision**: Choose to pay alone or split with others
4. **Contact Selection**: Pick contacts to split the bill with
5. **Amount Adjustment**: Customize payment amounts per participant
6. **Payment Method**: Select consolidated or direct payment
7. **Confirmation**: Review details and confirm payment

## Integration Guide

### 1. Import the component
```javascript
import { PaymentMenu } from './components/PaymentMenu';
```

### 2. Implement in your app
```javascript
function App() {
  const [paymentVisible, setPaymentVisible] = useState(false);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Your existing app content */}
      <Button 
        title="Split Payment" 
        onPress={() => setPaymentVisible(true)} 
      />
      
      <PaymentMenu 
        visible={paymentVisible} 
        onClose={() => setPaymentVisible(false)} 
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### 3. Customization Options
- **Theme**: Modify colors in the stylesheet
- **Contact List**: Replace sample contacts with real data
- **Payment Integration**: Connect to M-Pesa API in `handleFinalConfirmation`
- **Additional Features**: Add tip calculation or currency conversion

## Development Notes

### Testing the Bill Splitter
1. Start the Expo development server
2. Open the app on your device/simulator
3. Trigger the PaymentMenu component
4. Use sample data for testing:
   - Till Number: `123456`
   - Amount: `5000`
   - Sample contacts included
